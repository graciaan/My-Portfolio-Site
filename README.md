# Welcome to My Portfolio Site

Version 1

The purpose of this project is to create a portfolio website that I can continue to update along my journey as a web-developer/programmer.

As of this current writing, the website is still not complete. I will be updating the site as time goes on and my skills develop more.

I hope to have several projects available for viewing as they are completed and I will have periodic updates to the design and code of the site.

For now, please enjoy the first website I've ever created. Hopefully the future websites will look a lot better!
